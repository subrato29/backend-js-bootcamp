What is `nodemon`
```
`nodemon` is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
To use nodemon, replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.

i.e. Instead of using `node index.js`, write `nodemon index.js`
